						<h2>Who I am</h2>
						<p> As a senior on the verge of completing my degree in computer science at the University of
							Notre Dame (Go Irish!), I am driven by a relentless curiosity about the ever-evolving
							landscape of technology. My focus extends to the frontiers of XR (VR/AR/MR), computer
							vision, and machine learning, yet my appetite for learning knows no bounds.

							From crafting XR applications for analyzing LiDAR data in Unity Game Engine to building
							custom machine learning models predicting NBA game outcomes, my journey is marked by a
							passion for transforming theoretical concepts into tangible innovations.

							<h3>Into the Metaverse</h3>
							As I settled into my second day at Aeye Inc, a computer vision startup, I noticed a sticky
							note with 'Pointcloud in VR' scribbled on it. Following discussions with my mentor to set
							project goals, I embarked on the development of a VR application, aiming to enable users to
							visualize and interact with dynamic LiDAR pointcloud data.
							<br><br>
							After a week of thorough research, I found no evidence of anyone attempting this with
							dynamic data. Undeterred, I drew inspiration from techniques outlined in various research
							papers. Leveraging the capabilities of the Unity Game Engine and an HTC Vive 3, I set out to
							accomplish the task.
							<br><br>
							A couple of weeks later, a working prototype emerged. Despite its initial capabilities to
							load and navigate through pointclouds, I understood that optimization was pivotal for an
							enhanced user experience. Recognizing the potential, I strategically leveraged the
							multithreading and concurrency capabilities of the GPU in combination with Unity. This not
							only optimized the
							application's performance but also laid the groundwork for real-time data viewing from a
							sensorâ€”an achievement that brought the project one step closer to a seamless and dynamic
							user interaction. After presenting to the company, I had a line of people from all
							backgrounds
							coming by to try it on for themselves. Rendering over 1000 frames comprised of 2GB csvs each
							in seconds,
							the application was a success.
							<br><br>
							In the end, what started as a scribble on a sticky note unfolded into a transformative
							journey. The optimized VR application not only showcased the power of computer vision but
							also paved the way for real-time data visualization. This experience at Aeye not only
							sharpened my technical skills but reaffirmed my belief in the potential of pushing
							boundaries within the realms of technology.

							<h3>Predicting NBA Games</h3>
							<p>
								As my data structures class concluded, our final assignment beckoned: implement a data
								structure with practical use. Enticed by the allure of riches and terminonology such as machine learning,
								my team embarked on what turned out to be a challenging journey.
								<br><br>
								The following weeks blurred into a whirlwind of late nights, tutorials, and manuals, all
								within the confines of the windowless basement of the engineering building. Despite the
								frustration, we persisted and pieced together the necessary components. We collected and
								cleaned data, trained a machine learning model for classification, and implemented a
								minimum heap to fulfill the class requirements, showcasing the 'closest' games.
								<br><br>
								The culmination was a functioning NBA game predictor boasting an impressive 74% accuracy.
								Built utilizing PyTorch and Python, the model was trained on a dataset of over 7000
								games from the past several seasons. Feature engineering played a crucial role, extracting
								insights from player statistics, team performance, and historical match data.
								<br><br>
								The prediction algorithm considered various factors such as team momentum, statistics,
								and home-court advantage. Continuous refinement of the model involved tweaking
								hyperparameters and which statistics best represented a team's performance, enhancing its accuracy over time.
								<br><br>
								Our journey, though initially challenging, proved rewarding. The project not only
								demonstrated our proficiency in implementing sophisticated data structures but also
								highlighted the potential of combining machine learning and classical algorithms in
								predicting real-world scenarios. As we unveiled our NBA game predictor to our professor,
								the windowless basement transformed into a space of triumph, a testament to the
								determination and collaborative spirit that fueled our success.

							<h3>BetND</h3>
							<p>
								In the fall of 2022, I embarked on a journey to pioneer BetND, an on-campus sports
								betting marketplace that would soon become a hub for over 60 daily active users. This
								project not only showcased my technical skills but also highlighted my ability to lead
								and collaborate with a team of 4 peers.
								<br><br>
								One of the project's key innovations was the implementation of the ability to transact
								current bets with other users. For example, if a user placed a bet on a team to win,
								then halfway through the game the team was up by 20 points, the user could sell the bet
								to another user for a profit.
								<br><br>
								To support the robust functionalities of BetND, we engineered a comprehensive database.
								Comprising over 8000 entries distributed across 7 tables, the database was designed for
								organized and efficient data manipulation and access using SQL. This architecture laid
								the foundation for a reliable and scalable system that could handle the intricacies of
								sports betting data.
								<br><br>
								The culmination of our efforts resulted in the creation of a modern and user-intuitive
								multi-paged website. Developed using a tech stack that included PHP, JavaScript, and
								Python, the website presented users with all the relevant information they needed for
								informed and enjoyable betting experiences.
								<br><br>
								BetND stands not only as a testament to my technical prowess but also as a demonstration
								of effective collaboration, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit. This project has
								become a cornerstone in my portfolio, showcasing my ability to conceptualize, develop,
								and successfully launch a complex, data-driven platform.
